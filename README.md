User needs can be interpreted and implemented into a program by communicating with the product manger, who maintains consistent communication with the client regarding the project's requirements. User stories can help implement customer needs by organizing separate ideas. Programs should be developed incrementally with clear communication between developers and testers. Holding scrum meetings ensures everyone remains focused on their responsiblities and understands the overall scope of the project. I hope to incorporate this Agile process in future work so that I can be a good team member. Software development requires effort from many perspectives, and as a developer, I would adhere to the processes I have learned to facilitate efficiency in the Software Development Life Cycle.
